# Support Backend

This is a simple backend application for a Customer Support Assistant. It allows users to create support tickets, track ticket statuses, and interact with an AI for real-time responses. The app uses FastAPI for the backend, PostgreSQL as the database, and integrates with an AI service (like Groq API) for real-time responses.
